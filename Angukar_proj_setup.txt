You can see available generators via npm search yeoman-generator or via http://
yeoman.io/generators/.
Install them with npm install generator-karma:app.

To see all your installed generators run yo without any arguments. Adding the -
help option will also show subgenerators.

If yo cannot find the generator, run yo doctor to troubleshoot your system.
